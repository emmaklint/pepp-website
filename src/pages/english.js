      <P>
        Pepp is a mentoring program that intends to inspire more girls and young
        women to immerse themselves in technical studies. Pepp strives to
        encourage, challenge stereotypes and show the endless possibilities that
        engineering can offer. By gathering girls in upper secondary, university
        students and companies, Pepp creates a platform where thoughts and
        experiences can be exchanged, dreams grow and visions created.

        Visionaries in Pepp shares the goal to see more female engineers and are
        convinced that this initiative can make a difference. The target group
        is girls in ages between 16 to 18, they get the opportunity to talk to a
        mentor – who majors in technical studies on university level – about
        anything they wish, where sky is the limit. The mentee will also be able
        to attend evenings filled with inspiration in collaboration with
        companies and motivational speakers, where they get an insight of what
        an engineer can do after finished studies, both expected and unexpected
        roles. The mentorship program is financed through volunteer work and
        with contributions from companies who share the same vision of the
        significance of more girls entering the world of engineering.
